## About

Thiago decided to enter the e-commerce sector (online sales), in addition, he decided to create his own app. Wanting his app to be developed with the best technologies, he contacted compass.uol. This application aims to provide a better experience for online shoppers, with the application of Design system, innovative flows and clean layout.

"npm install" for install the dependences
"Npm run dev" for localhost
"Npm run dev" for back-end Api in api folder
"npm run storybook" for storybook

api deploy link: https://compass-ecommerce.onrender.com

front deploy link: https://compass-front-challenge-pwa-e-commerce-theme-kermitthesapo.vercel.app/

Currently working for mobile screens: 420px and desktop: 1440px.

It is recommended to use npm run dev in the api, because the api is slow and when a long time goes by without being used it is kind of disabled
